# Classification-of-Penguins
Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Model ( KNN clustering) to classify Penguins based on some input(Independent Variable))
============================================================================================================================
Analysis-
The dataset was then analyzed by checking different relationships between the independent and dependent variables.

Methods used in the analysis are - Using Sea-born(SNS), Bar-plot was plotted to show these relationships, and classify the dependent variable.

Multiple Collinearity was checked for using HeatMap and Variance Inflation Factor.

Kmeans was used to check for the Elbow Curve- To see the amount of clusters present 

N-cluster was used to validate the Elbow Curve
============================================================================

Building the Model:

One classification model was used - KNN clustering Model 

Using the confusion matrix table was carried out to check the amount of True classified and Falsely Classified

Classification Report was visualized to check for the Precision, Recall,  F-score , and the Support
